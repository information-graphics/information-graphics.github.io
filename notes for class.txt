FINAL PROJECT

* But it must contain a map, a chart, and a diagram — I'd pick one form, make it dominant, and then have the other forms support it. It can be a redesign of a metro map (maybe the nyc subway! or of the <a href="http://ferry.nyc">new nyc ferry service</a>), can be a book, can be a wall chart, can be a motion project, can be a physical thing (maybe something that folds up into something else), can be personal or based on data (here are 2 good lists of datasets, <a href="https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets">public data</a> & <a href="http://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/archive">data is plural</a> newsletter), or anything else you can think of.

You can also work in pairs if you'd like, but know that then I'll be expecting a project twice as good. 


============
Assignment 8 
Network Diagram.
Make a network diagram. Bring it to class with you next week.


============
Assignment 7 
Heart Diagram.
Make a diagram the human heart. No smaller than 11in x 17in. Some examples of diagrams I showed in class.

============
Mapping Project
Wall Map
Make a 20 in. x 30 in. wall map of whatever you want. It can be illustrated or done in QGIS, but I want you to think about telling a story with the map. What do you want the map to convey? What should the map show? What data do you need to show that? Where can you get that data? Also think about type, layout, labeling, and color and how that can help or hurt the story.

============
Assignment 6
Part I: Using QGIS make a map of <i>anything</i>, but think about the story behind it, why you chose what you chose, and what to annotate about it. If you need help with QGIS, please let me know. Also, there are many <a href="http://docs.qgis.org/2.2/en/docs/user_manual/">resources</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwqof0ywWA8">tutorials</a> online for help.

Part II: Create a personal hand-drawn map using only black sharpie. Again, think about the story and what it says about you. These are the examples I showed in class. <a href="http://www.nobutakaaozaki.com/maps.html">From here to here</a> and <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/Everything_Sings_Excerpt_and_Intro.pdf">Denis Wood</a>.

============
Assignment 5
Download <a href="data/world_map_with_layers.ai">this file</a>. Make 3 different maps from the layers provided. You do not have to use all of the layers. Print them out and bring them to class.


============
Charting Project
Quantified self.
Due on Feb. 20

Start tracking data about yourself and your daily habits. We talked a number of options in class. Your project is to visualize that data in a booklet of at least 8 pages. The booklet can be as big or small as you'd like and contain any number of charts and forms. You can also use data that you've previously been tracking. But ultimately all of this should tell a story about you.


============
Assignment 4
Sketches for your charting project. Let me know what you're tracking and please email them to me.


============
Assignment 3

Starting with the same <a href="data/titanic-data.csv" target="_blank">data set</a> we used last week (now you're very familiar with it, which is good!), <b>create two 11 in. x 17 in. spreads</b> (or larger if you want!) — one from the <b>perspective of the company</b> of who built the Titanic, one from the <b>perspective of a family member</b> who was lost on the titanic.

I don't really care how many charts you use, but think about how can you use charts — in combination with type, color, layout and annotation — to tell a story. You can also use additional data or research that you find, but cite your sources.


============
Assignment 2

Download <a href="data/titanic-data.csv" target="_blank">this data set</a> about the people who were on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic" target="_blank">Titanic's last voyage</a>. Make <b>25 different chart sketches</b> in whatever size and style you'd like. They can be very rough. 

We talked about Excel, Google Drive, <a href="http://raw.densitydesign.org/" target="_blank">Raw</a>, and Illustrator in class. You can use any of these programs, or, more likely, a combination of them.

<b>Pick 5</b> of those sketches to make into final versions. Those final versions can be as big as you'd like, but shouldn't be smaller than 8.5 in. wide x 5.5 in. tall.

<b>Print out</b> all of your sketches, and your 5 finals and bring them to class next Monday.
