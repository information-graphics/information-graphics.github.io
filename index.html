    This class is about learning how to tell a story through visuals — primarliy through the use of charts, maps, diagrams and other visual forms. 

    <br>
    <br>

    A few things you should know — 

    <br>
    <br>

    <b>Show up to class.</b>
    If you can't, let me know. For each unexcused absence, you lose 5% from your final grade. More than 3 and you fail. 

    <br>
    <br>

    <b>Do you work.</b>
    There will be four major assignments each worth 100 points. You will be graded on the process and progress, just as much as the final piece. You will present and we will crit each final piece. There will be other smaller readings and graded assignments along the way. 
    
    <br>
    <br>

    <b>I will not accept late assignments. </b>

    <br>
    <br>

    <b>Process is important.</b>
    You will be rewarded for taking risks, even if those risks fail, and you can show your process. 

    <br>
    <br>

    <b>Participate. </b>
    You are exepcted to participate each class. Group projects will be common and you'll be graded on your effort.

    <br>
    <br> 

    <b>I am here to help.</b>
    Do not hesistate to ask for help at any time. I am happy to come early, stay late, or meet with you at another time to make sure you're successful in this class. Do not wait until the last minute. 

    <br>
    <br>

    <b>Bring your laptop to every class. </b>

    <br>
    <br>

    <b>Don't text or use your computer for personal stuff. </b>
